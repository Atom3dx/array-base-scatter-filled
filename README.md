### Overview
The **Array Base Scatter Filled** utility function offers a straightforward way to scatter values into a new array based on specified indices. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to fill an array with specific values at certain positions. Whether you are working on a data manipulation task, algorithm implementation, or any other project that involves array operations, this utility function can streamline the process for you.

### How to Use
To utilize the **Array Base Scatter Filled** utility function in your JavaScript project, you can follow these simple steps:
1. Download the software from the provided link.
2. Import or require the utility function in your JavaScript file.
3. Use the function by providing the list of values to scatter and the indices where they should be placed in the new array.

### Example
Here is a quick example to demonstrate how you can use the **Array Base Scatter Filled** utility function:

```javascript
const arrayScatterFilled = require('array-scatter-filled');

const values = [10, 20, 30];
const indices = [1, 3, 5];
const length = 6;

const scatteredArray = arrayScatterFilled(values, indices, length);
console.log(scatteredArray); // Output: [0, 10, 0, 20, 0, 30]
```

In this example, we scatter the values `[10, 20, 30]` to positions `[1, 3, 5]` in an array of length `6`, resulting in the array `[0, 10, 0, 20, 0, 30]`.
